### Installation

1. Download this repo and unpack CSS.
2. Open [Typora](http://typora.io).
3. Select Preferences > Open Theme Folder
4. Copy writing.css to the Theme folder
5. Purchase fonts of your choice and add them to `writing` subdirectory in Theme folder. Fonts used in Medium.com between 2013 to 2015 are predefined in writing.css.

**Please note:** You can use any fonts with this theme. You will need to create `writing` subdirectory and place your downloaded or purchased fonts that directory. By default this theme uses [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) in Headings and [Merriweather](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather) in paragraphs which are pretty close free alternatives to Medium's fonts.

All fonts are just regular, **bold**, *regular italic* and ***bold italic***.
