Typora CSS theme. Plain and simple. Aiming for the [Medium](http://medium.com)-like writing experience.

### Installation

1. Download this repo and unpack CSS.
2. Open [Typora](http://typora.io).
3. Select Preferences > Open Theme Folder
4. Copy writing.css to the Theme folder
5. Purchase webfonts of your choice and place them to the `writing` subdirectory in Theme folder (create new folder if it doesn't exist). Fonts used in Medium.com between 2013 to 2015 are predefined in writing.css, note you will only need woff-files which are named accordingly.

**Please note:** You can use any fonts with this theme. You will need to create `writing` subdirectory and place your downloaded or purchased fonts to that directory. By default this theme uses [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) in Headings and [Merriweather](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather) in paragraphs which are pretty close free alternatives to Medium's fonts.

All fonts are just regular, **bold**, *regular italic* and ***bold italic***.

### Recommended fonts

##### Paragraphs (preferred): [Charter](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/charter/)
